Subject of the Website: Argentinian Mate & Products Online Store

Planned Content of the Website: This website will be an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling yerba mate and other traditional Argentinian products. It will feature a variety of yerba mate brands, mate gourds, bombillas, and other related accessories. Additionally, the store will offer Argentinian food products such as dulce de leche, alfajores, and other specialties. Customers will be able to browse categories, read product descriptions, and make secure purchases online.

Reason for Choosing This Subject: I am originally from Argentina and have been living abroad for over five years. Finding Argentinian products outside of Argentina is often difficult and expensive. Because of this, I am considering opening an online store in the future to provide easy access to authentic Argentinian goods within the USA. This website will serve as the foundation for that venture, helping fellow Argentinians and enthusiasts of Argentinian culture find the products they love.

Color Schema: The website will feature colors inspired by the Argentinian flag:
•	Sky Blue (#75AADB): Used for headers, buttons, and accents.
•	White (#FFFFFF): Used for the background and text contrast.
•	Golden Yellow (#F7C242): Used for highlights and call-to-action elements, representing the sun from the Argentinian flag.
